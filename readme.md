##  What is Matdown?

**Matdown** is a compact, dependency-free equation editor that turns lightweight math expressions into styled, semantic HTML â€” no LaTeX, no external libraries, no regrets.

Itâ€™s inspired by the realization that game engines, like cloud services, are just real-time systems â€” and HTML/CSS are expressive primitives that deserve more credit.

##  Why ?

- âœ… No parser generators
- âœ… Minimal AST
- âœ… No LaTeX
- âœ… No DOM hell
- âœ… No stylesheets from the Math Wizard Societyâ„¢ ruining your vibe

Instead:
- âœ¨ Inline keyboard editing
- âœ¨ Don't worry about parenthesis (math aware input)
- âœ¨ Renders DOM directly (fractions, exponents, etc.)
- âœ¨ Leverages the box model & inline layout

##  Why Not KaTeX or LaTeX?

You donâ€™t need a compiler to render a fraction. You need a `<div>`. Matdown leans into browser-native layouts â€” because **HTML is the universal rendering target** anyway.

##  Philosophy

> Good : Games :: Well-Architected : Cloud Implementations

HTML and CSS arenâ€™t just for design â€” theyâ€™re universal, transferable skills. If you know how to style a fraction, you can style a dashboard, a mobile shell, or a pixel-perfect game HUD. **Thatâ€™s runtime literacy.**
